GlyphPDF **v1.5.0** — the consolidation release. Months of parity and hardening work that lived on separate branch lines has been reviewed, fixed and landed on one branch: new form-script, accessibility-tagging, batch-preset and signing workflows, and a large security and reliability pass. The whole suite runs green on this build: 189 registered test suites; 188 run, and one deliberately disabled probe does not.

## Downloads
| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| **GlyphPDF-1.5.0-x64.msi** | Installer (recommended). Major-upgrades any prior install; Start-menu + desktop shortcuts. |
| **GlyphPDF-1.5.0-x64-portable.zip** | No-install portable edition — unzip anywhere, run `GlyphPDF.exe`. |

Each artifact ships with a matching `.sha256`. Fully self-contained: the Qt runtime, PDFium, PoDoFo, the ONNX OCR models, tessdata and veraPDF are bundled. **No network access is required.**

## What's new
- **Form scripts.** AcroForm Calculate, Format, Keystroke and Validate scripts now run in a sandboxed quickjs-ng runtime with a CPU deadline. Calculated totals, formatted values and keystroke filtering behave the way the form author intended.
- **Accessibility.**
  - A checker for tagging problems.
  - **Tag Document**: builds a real structure tree for untagged documents, while preserving inline images and marked content.
  - Reading-order issues are listed as rows you can jump to.
- **Batch presets.**
  - Bates numbering in a run-ordered lane.
  - Rename-on-conflict, and stop-on-failure with truthful "not run" reporting.
  - Preset import and export.
  - A per-step measured-bytes report (JSON and CSV).
  - Hot-folder ingest.
  - A preset manager with a multi-step editor.
- **Signing.**
  - The Draw, Type and Upload signature picker; every mode persists as a real PDF annotation.
  - Visible signature appearances.
  - **Prepare Request** (Protect ▸ Sign) sets up a document for others to sign.
  - A certify selector.
  - Certificate-based encryption with a recipient picker.
- **Review.**
  - A printable review summary: comments grouped by page, with status and totals.
  - Comments filter, table view and CSV export.
  - Compare shows added and removed pages, aligns inserted pages, and filters by change type.
- **Viewing.**
  - Night Mode page inversion, mutually exclusive with Eye Care.
  - Annotations and search highlights are visible in two-page mode.
- **Editing.**
  - Letter spacing, line spacing and opacity for inline text edits.
  - Image move, resize, rotate-by-angle, restack and opacity are written into the PDF.
  - Same-name image placements are each addressable.
- **OCR.**
  - The Deskew, Binarize and Denoise options drive the pipeline.
  - 1-bit binarization keeps paper light.
  - Reviewed text survives save and extraction, on the correct page.
- **Export.**
  - In-house DOCX and XLSX writers.
  - Table columns become real spreadsheet cells.
  - A local-processing notice on every export and import.
  - PDF/A-2U and 3U no longer downgrade silently.
- **Administration.** A machine policy file can manage selected preferences. Managed settings are always shown as "Managed by policy". The policy file must be admin-owned to take effect.

## Security & reliability
- **Set Expiry Date could damage your document. Fixed.** In v1.4.0 the expiry was written into the open file while that file was still being read. Setting an expiry a second time could leave a file that no longer opens. The expiry could also be silently dropped while the command reported success. The write now goes through the same atomic save path as every other edit, and the expiry is verified before the original is replaced. If you used Set Expiry Date in v1.4.0, check that those documents still open and carry the date you set.

This release's new code went through two independent reviews before shipping.
- **43 of 46 findings from the parity review fixed (PGR-01…46).** They include:
  - an in-place re-sign that could delete the only copy (critical);
  - a batch merge that reported success without writing a file;
  - redaction proofs that could falsely pass on rotated, offset or nested-container content;
  - CSV formula injection in the conversion and comments exports;
  - secret-store binding and roaming issues;
  - a save-path use-after-free.
  - Of the three not fixed: one is dead code that stays disabled, and two are disclosed below or pinned by tests.
- **17 of 17 findings from the second code review fixed (CX-01…17).** They include:
  - Tag Document destroying inline images;
  - Office conversion overwriting a sibling file;
  - two accessibility-panel deadlocks;
  - several content-stream editing corruptions.
- **Caught and fixed by release verification, before shipping.** None of these reached a published build:
  - a deadlock between background autosave and the viewer, on this release's new file-coordination path;
  - a failed tagging run that never reported completion;
  - a test-isolation flaw that made two conversion suites fail when run in parallel.
- A sanitizer gate (ASan + UBSan) now runs in CI, and a provisioned fuzzing workflow is in place.

## Known limitations
- **Form scripts:** a crafted script that triggers a native sparse-array scan can outlast the CPU deadline and stall the app (PGR-40). The fix is not yet in any quickjs-ng release; the behaviour is disclosed and pinned by a test that turns on automatically once a fixed runtime is available. Opening untrusted forms that carry scripts carries this risk.
- **CSV exports:** three smaller CSV exports (measurements, the batch run report and the error log) quote their fields but do not yet neutralize formula-leading cells. Open them in a spreadsheet with care.
- **Automatic updates** stay dormant until a code-signed build ships: the updater refuses unsigned installers by design.
- The interface is **English only**; the Arabic, French and German translation packages are not yet commissioned.

## ⚠️ Unsigned build
Like prior releases, this build is **not code-signed** (no EV certificate yet). Windows SmartScreen will warn on first launch — choose **More info → Run anyway**. Verify integrity against the published **SHA-256** before running.
